Congress used “disproportionate” crime rates to craft the legislation, restricting the rights of “overwhelmingly law-abiding citizens,” and it failed to show that licensed dealers were the source of guns used by young adults to commit crimes, the court ruled.</p></blockquote><p>There is still a long way to go. And it doesn't help that the globalist governments of the West are trying to force discrimination against anyone smart enough to avoid injecting the spike proteins. But there are silver linings among the growing clouds.</p><p>No one said it would be easy. In fact, they repeatedly warned you that it wouldn't be.</p><p></p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel="tag" href="http://voxday.blogspot.com/search/label/gun%20control">gun control</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://voxday.blogspot.com/search/label/law">law</a></p>
